/**
 * DEVELOPMENT-ONLY wipe of the dev project's member data, with a keep-list.
 *   npm run seed:wipe                                  preview only (default): counts + accounts
 *   npm run seed:wipe -- --confirm-wipe=<project-ref>  also asks you to type "DELETE <project-ref>"
 *
 * What it does when confirmed: for each account NOT in SEED_KEEP_EMAILS it removes the account's
 * storage objects through the Storage API, then deletes the user from auth.users. The foreign keys
 * cascade to profiles, posts, likes, comments, education, experience, skills, preferences and
 * network rows. It never truncates, drops, or touches migrations, auth config, buckets or policies.
 *
 * Storage limits: the Storage API only lets a member delete their own files, and this tool only
 * holds passwords for accounts it created (scripts/.seed-output/accounts.json). Files that belong
 * to any other account cannot be removed through the API; the preview and the final report list
 * how many there are instead of reaching for a privileged key.
